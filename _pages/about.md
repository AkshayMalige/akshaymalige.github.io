I'm Akshay Malige, a physicist and FPGA/ML hardware engineer. I build detector readout electronics, FPGA-based data acquisition systems and accelerate ML algoritms on edge platforms for high-energy physics experiments, with contributions across [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/), [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/), [HADES](https://hades.gsi.de/), [PANDA](https://panda.gsi.de/), and [GRAMS](https://grams.sites.northeastern.edu/). I specialize in VHDL, HLS, hls4ml, Alveo and Versal ACAP platforms, with 40+ peer-reviewed publications.

Currently, I am a Post-doctoral Research Associate at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/world/) working on ATLAS Event Filter tracking (ML on Xilinx Alveo) and a Versal ACAP based real-time (μs–s) feature extraction system.
